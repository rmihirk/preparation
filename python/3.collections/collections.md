## 📚 Collections
Choose your collection based on mutability and uniqueness needs.

### Lists: Ordered, mutable.

  Lists are Python's most versatile collection. They are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
  
  #### ⚙️ List Characteristics
  * **Ordered:** They maintain the order in which elements are inserted.
  * **Mutable:** You can change, add, and remove items after the list is created.
  * **Allows Duplicates:** Since lists are indexed, they can have items with the same value.
  * **Heterogeneous:** A single list can contain different data types (e.g., `[1, "Apple", True]`).
  

### Tuples: ordered, immutable

 #### ⚙️ List Characteristics
  * **Ordered:** Elements have a fixed position.
  * **Immutable:** Once created, you cannot change, add, or remove elements.
  * **Indexed:** Access elements by index (starting at 0).
  * **Heterogeneous:** Can store different data types (int, str, float, etc.).
    

### Sets: unique, unordered

#### ⚙️ List Characteristics
  * **Unordered:** No guaranteed order of elements.
  * **Unique:** Automatically removes duplicates.
  * **Mutable:**  You can add or remove elements.
  * **Unindexed:**  You cannot access elements by index.


### Dicts: Key-value pairs.
```python
user = {"name": "Mihir", "role": "QA Architect"}
```

#### Mental Model: 
Choose based on mutability and uniqueness needs.
