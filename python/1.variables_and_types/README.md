## 🧩 Variables and Types

### 💡 Concepts
- Dynamically typed: you don’t declare types explicitly.
- Everything is an object in Python.

### 📝 Examples
```python
x = 10          # int
y = 3.14        # float
name = "Mihir"  # str
active = True   # bool
```

#### Mental model: 
Think of variables as labels pointing to objects, not boxes holding values
